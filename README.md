# Snake

Basic clone of the classic snake game with a few tweaks and additional features. Made in Godot 3.1.

# Project scope

The goal is to make a small game following the classic snake formula while adding a few additional features to make it more unique and enjoyable than a direct copy of the original.

I may finish working on this game before all of the missing features are implemented, but this repository will always be open for new contributions and edits.

# Missing features and contributions

Recommended features for contribution:
* More food types
  * Draw new food sprites
  * Implement a random selection between different food types
* Slowly scale snake tail sprite size downwards the more there are, giving it a proper snake shape

Features that I plan to implement:
  * Main menu
  * Display score in the panel below the game
  * Add 3 speed options

Do not work on the features that I plan to implement myself, I might have finished them already. Also do not add anything sound related to avoid issues with licensingâ€”if you'd like to suggest additional sound effects or sound tracks, post about it in the issues tab under the "Enhancements" label.
All other additions to the game are welcome, especially the recommended features mentioned above. Other valuable contributions include code optimization, improving comments, fixing and reporting issues in the issues tab.
