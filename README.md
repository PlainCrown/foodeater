# Contributions:

Anyone can contribute to FoodEater by playing the game and reporting any bugs they find in the comments section of the game page, or in the issues tab on GitHub. A good bug report should explain exactly how and when the bug occurred. It's difficult to fix a bug that cannot be re-created by following the same steps. Videos and screenshots also help.

Other valuable contributions include suggestions and recommendations on how the game could be improved. These can be posted in the issues tab with the "enhancement" label. Users with GDScript knowledge can also contribute by fixing bugs in the issues tab, adding new features, and optimizing code.
